<!-- <p> HELLO
My name is Ester Aagaard, and I’m an exchange student from Denmark, studying here at Sogang University for this semester.

In my class; ”Digital Arts and Scholarly Craft in Korean Studies”, I am doing a project where I am investigating cultural bias in Machine learning (Computer vision).

Computer vision is a technology, that makes it possible for the computer to look at pictures and detect which objects are displayed in the specific pictures. This is used in many everyday technologies, such as facial recognition, or apps such as pinterest, google photes etc.

In my project I am going to compare a specific algorithm/computer visions ability to detect Korean cultural objects in pictures I receive through a survey. And this is the point where you come into the picture.

To succeed with this project, I need participants to fill out my survey. The participants must be Koreans and be able to understand English, since the survey is in English. The survey consist of two parts; first questions about your affiliation to Korea, second you are asked to find between 3-5 pictures which you think show Korean cultural objects.

The results of the survey will make is possible for me to proceed with my project. If you can spare some time to fill out the survey, and are interested in helping me, I would very much appreciate it. And it would be a BIG help! You find the survey at this link:
